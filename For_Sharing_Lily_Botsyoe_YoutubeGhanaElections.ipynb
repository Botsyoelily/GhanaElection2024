All these political parties are there for themselves. They offer monies for votes to go on with their own programs. If they all want the welfare of the country why don&#39;t they all come together with one aim or purpose to build the country. The EC and her office should rather invite all who wants to contest for the election to come under one purpose to help in building the country. The Youth of Ghana is now tired of the two teams npp&#39;s and ndc&#39;s. We need a different young man with fresh ideas and energy to lead the country Ghana. There is no one other than Nana Kwame Bediako, who is coming with The Fresh, New Unstoppable Force from The Almighty God to lead and build the Nation Ghana. We are all to join together to support Nana Kwame Bediako for Ghana to be Great Again. All votes should go to The New Force to move the country Ghana forward. If we all support him with his 12 Pillars, The Almighty God will rejoice over us all and will affect The entire Continent. Joy will be everywhere in AFRICA.

May the wall of 🔥 🔥🔥 be a constant protection of Jehovah, Abba Father. Your going and coming will all be protected.  Amen.<br><br>Question.... HE JM, please will arrest and  cease all the money npp has stolen, cease the 6 million restaurant funded by Ghana money for his daughter&#39;s restaurant?   Will you please take back all the shops given to  nana addo&#39;s daughter who has been given monopoly of airport shops. Given unfairly without bidding. This Present government under nana addo and his friends and family have REALLY caused a lot of damage in Ghana,  does not care about Ghana.  Galamsey, allowing the chinese to destroy our waters with deadly chemicals. Why will a leader allow a foreigner to destroy our land? The gold should be for our people. Mr JM our resources should be our people first. <br><br>I totally agree, it does not make sense Importing rice when we can export our own goods and I crease our economy. <br><br>USA, China and European countries have good economic growth due to 24 hours work. All developed countries have 24 hour work force. It is a brilliant strategy Mr President.  I am thanking the Lord for saving Ghana from the evil plan of Agyapadee manual which nana addo and co have as a strategy. No weapon formed against Ghana will prosper. All evil wicked leaders looking to change our history will not succeed.  We will remember Kwame  Nkrumah who put Ghana on the map. We don&#39;t want children of traitors who back stabbed  Nkrumah and stopping him from making Ghana first world. Thank you Lord that no evil planned in this Agyapadee book has been brought out in the light.  As of now we  childfen of light will have the Government of Jesus. Which is to serve the people, bring prosperity, take away hardships, take away poverty, remove  corruption, re educate mindset of people to think Ghana first and help our economy grow.  Let us all be in prayer to ensure the day of voting the Lord sends the angels of the Lord to oversee and ensure this present rogue leaders will not cheat. Ghanaians do not vote by tribe vote as a united Ghana, vote for a leader who cares and want to serve, intelligent and has the heart to be righteous.  Vote John Mahama.  Dont think party think leader.

Those who are led by the spirit they are the sons of God Rom <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvOSTyJC5LM&amp;t=494\">8:14</a>. In these last days the Lord has poured His spirit upon all flesh. We are not in the days of Moses, David and the fathers of old. We have a better covenant.  God speaks to us directly.  The spirit of God dwells in us. Obey the commandments of Jesus, and nothing shall be impossible to you.  <br><br>Any so-called prophet who tries to instil fear in you ask the Lord to rubuke them. They are being led by familiar spirits, not the spirit of the Lord. In 1st Corinthians 14:3 But he that prophesies speaks unto men for edification and exhortation and comfort. Therefore, if anybody says come and see him or her if not this or that will happen, simply say the Lord rebuke you.<br><br>Our lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is our high priest not prophets!<br>In Matthew 12:42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. <br><br>Our Lord made is clear in Matthew  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvOSTyJC5LM&amp;t=762\">12:42</a> that He&#39;s greater than the wisdom of Solomon.<br>We must read the book of proverbs and all the books of the old testament through the finished works of Jesus Christ. <br><br>Fear not! Ignore any prophecy that is negative and ask the Lord for revelation of his word and your life will never be the same .<br>God bless you\n",
